# Multi-core-Pipeline-CPU-
The pipeline uses multiprocessing module in python to facilitate training, tuning and analyzing brain signals

The Deep learning models are trained and features extracted from the last pooling layers. These features are used in training
regular classifiers (Random Forest, ANN, SVM and KNN) to identify participants

An update to this pipeline can not be made public due to signed NDA.
